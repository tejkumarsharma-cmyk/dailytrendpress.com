              Most teams do not need another blog template. They need a professional front door for announcements, a consistent
              reading experience, and an archive that still makes sense six months later. That is the product surface {SITE_CONFIG.name}{" "}
              optimizes for—without hiding the underlying publishing engine that keeps your routes, tasks, and feeds compatible
              with the rest of the platform.
            </p>
            <p className="text-sm leading-relaxed text-muted-foreground">
              We bias toward clarity: transparent pricing lanes, predictable story pages, and UI that looks like a modern newswire
              instead of a recolored consumer app.
